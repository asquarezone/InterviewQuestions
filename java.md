1. Is Java Platform Independent if then how?
Yes, Java is a Platform Independent language. Unlike many programming languages javac compiles the program to form a bytecode or .class file. This file is independent of the software or hardware running but needs a JVM(Java Virtual Machine) file preinstalled in the operating system for further execution of the bytecode.

Although JVM is platform dependent, the bytecode can be created on any System and can be executed in any other system despite hardware or software being used which makes Java platform independent.

2. What are the top Java Features?
Java is one the most famous and most used language in the real world, there are many features in Java that makes it better than any other language some of them are mentioned below:

Features-of-Java-768

Simple: Java is quite simple to understand and the syntax
Platform Independent: Java is platform independent means we can run the same program in any software and hardware and will get the same result.
Interpreted: Java is interpreted as well as a compiler-based language. 
Robust: features like Garbage collection, exception handling, etc that make the language robust.
Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented language that supports the concepts of class,  objects, four pillars of OOPS, etc. 
Secured: As we can directly share an application with the user without sharing the actual program makes Java a secure language. 
High Performance:  faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages.
Dynamic: supports dynamic loading of classes and interfaces.
Distributed: feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine connected.
Multithreaded: deal with multiple tasks at once by defining multiple threads
Architecture Neutral: it is not dependent on the architecture.
3. What is JVM?
JVM-768

JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine it is a Java interpreter. It is responsible for loading, verifying, and executing the bytecode created in Java.

Although it is platform dependent which means the software of JVM is different for different Operating Systems it plays a vital role in making Java platform Independent.
