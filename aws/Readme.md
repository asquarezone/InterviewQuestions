What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering over 200 services including computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities. It is popular due to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and global reach12.
What are the key components of AWS?
Key components include:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Scalable virtual servers.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for data.
RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed database service.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolated network environment23.
Explain Amazon S3.
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, known for its durability and scalability24.
What is EC2?
EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers on demand and pay only for the resources they use13.
What is a VPC?
A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) enables users to create a logically isolated network within AWS, where they can define their IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways24.
Intermediate AWS Interview Questions
What is the difference between S3 and EBS?
S3 is an object storage service designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data accessible via the internet, while EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides block-level storage for EC2 instances12.
What are security best practices for Amazon EC2?
Best practices include using IAM roles for access control, restricting inbound traffic with security groups, regularly reviewing security group rules, and disabling password-based logins24.
Explain Auto Scaling.
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic demands, ensuring optimal performance and cost management by scaling resources up or down as needed13.
What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. Users pay only for the compute time consumed45
.
Advanced AWS Interview Questions
What is Amazon ECS?
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) simplifies running and managing Docker containers on AWS by providing a highly scalable container orchestration service that integrates with other AWS services like ELB and CloudWatch12.
Describe how you would design a scalable web application on AWS.
To design a scalable web application, I would use:
EC2 for compute capacity,
RDS or DynamoDB for database management,
S3 for storage,
Implementing Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly,
Utilizing Auto Scaling to adjust resources based on demand14.
What is AWS Direct Connect?
AWS Direct Connect establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS, providing more consistent network performance compared to internet-based connections, ideal for high-throughput workloads13.
Explain the significance of AWS Organizations.
AWS Organizations allows you to manage multiple AWS accounts centrally, applying policies across accounts and simplifying billing processes while enhancing security by enforcing compliance standards12.
These questions cover a broad spectrum of topics relevant to freshers entering the field of cloud computing with AWS. Familiarity with these concepts will enhance your confidence during interviews and improve your chances of success in landing an AWS-related role
