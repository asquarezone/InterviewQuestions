Hybrid Cloud: It combines both the public and private clouds facilitating the flow of data and applications in sharing between them.
6. Why is Azure Diagnostics APIs needed?
Azure Diagnostics APIs are used to collect and store the diagnostic data such as logs and metrics from the applications that are running in Azure. It helps in monitoring performance, identifying the issues and maintaining the application health.

7. Define Azure Service Level Agreements (SLA)?
Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are the formal documents that are used for defining the performance and availability standards that Azure services must meet. They specify the uptime guarantees and provides the remedies or compensations if these standards or not met.

8. What is Azure Resource Manager?
It is a service that provides the management layer for all the Azure resources. It supports the users to deploy, manage and organize the resources through a unified interfaces using the templates in a declarative syntax.

9. What is NSG?
NSG stands for Network Security Group, it is a feature in Azure that provides the control on inbound and outbound traffic of to and from Azure resources. IT allows the users in defining the security rules to filter the traffic based on the IP address, port and protocol.

10. Why do you choose your Career in Cloud Computing?
The career on the Cloud Computing provides the opportunities to work with cutting-edge technologies, high demand for skilled professionals and it is potential for significant career growth and impact.

11. Why do you Choose Microsoft Azure and Not AWS?
The selection of Microsoft Azure over AWS is because of better integration with Microsoft products, competitive pricing, extensive hybrid cloud capabilities, and comprehensive enterprise solutions tailored for various industries.

12. How Does Microsoft Azure Differs Compared to AWS Cloud?
Azure offers stronger integration with Microsoft products and services, robust hybrid cloud solutions, and a user-friendly interface. AWS is known for its vast range of services and global market leadership. The choice depends on specific business needs and existing IT infrastructure.

11. What is Azure Redis Cache?
Azure Redis is a managed in-memory cache service that is based on the open-source Redis software. It provides high-performancde, scalable and cost-effective caching

12. Define Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
Azure virtual machine scale sets are the type of service in Azure that allows us in creating and manage a group of identical, balanced VMs. They facilitate with automatic scaling of number of VMs in response to the demand. It ensures wit high availability and performance.

13. What do you understand about the "Availability Set"?
An Availability set is a grouping of VMs within a data center ensuring the high availability by distributing VMs across multiple isolated hardware nodes reducing the risk of simultaneous failures.

14. What are the available options for deployment environments provided by Azure?
Azure offers several deployment environments: Azure App Service for web apps, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for containerized applications, Azure Virtual Machines for custom environments, and Azure Functions for serverless computing.

15. What do you need to do when drive failure occurs?
When a drive failure occurs, Azure provides automatic redundancy and backup options. Ensure regular backups are in place, and use Azure Site Recovery or other replication services to restore data and minimize downtime.

16. Is it possible to design an application that handles the connection failure in Azure?
Yes, applications can be designed to handle connection failures by implementing retry logic, using Azure's built-in fault-tolerant services, and leveraging Azure Traffic Manager for failover capabilities.

17. Define Azure Storage Key.
An Azure Storage Key is a security key used to authenticate access to Azure Storage accounts. There are two keys (primary and secondary) provided for redundancy, allowing for key rotation without downtime.

18. What is cspack in Azure?
The cspack is a command-line tool that used for generating a service package files for deployment to Azure Cloud Services. It packages application binaries, configuration files, and other resources into a format that Azure can deploy.

19. What is the best Azure Solution for executing the code without a server?
Azure Functions are the best solution for executing the code without a server providing a serverless computing environment where it can run an event-driven code without managing the infrastructure.

20. What would be the best feature recommended by Azure for having a common file-sharing system between multiple virtual machines?
Azure File Share is the best feature for a common file-sharing system. It provides fully managed file shares in the cloud that can be accessed via SMB protocol by multiple VMs.

21. Is it possible to log in to a Linux Virtual Machine without using a password?
Yes, it is possible to log in to a Linux VM without a password through SSH key-based authentication. Go through the ssh configuration enable the password authentication and restart the ssh service then try on login to that VM without using password Here ensure the login user that doesn't have any password to login.

22. What are the differences between Azure Scale Sets and Availability Sets?
Azure Scale Sets allow automatic scaling of VMs based on demand, whereas Availability Sets ensure high availability by distributing VMs across multiple fault and update domains. Scale Sets provide scaling, and Availability Sets provide redundancy.

23. What is Azure Blob Storage?
Azure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data such as text, binary data, images, and videos. It is highly scalable and accessible over HTTP/HTTPS.

24. What are the instance types offered by Azure?
Azure offers various instance types, including General Purpose (e.g., D-series), Compute Optimized (e.g., F-series), Memory Optimized (e.g., E-series), Storage Optimized (e.g., L-series), and GPU instances (e.g., N-series) to cater to different workloads and requirements.
