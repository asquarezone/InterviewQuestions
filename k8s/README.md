# Basic Kubernetes Questions

* What is Kubernetes?

* Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows for efficient management of clusters of hosts running Linux containers23

* What are K8s?

* K8s is simply a shorthand term for Kubernetes, which is derived from the Greek word for "helmsman" or "captain," reflecting its role in managing containerized applications23.

* Explain the architecture of Kubernetes.

* Kubernetes architecture consists of a master node and worker nodes. The master node manages the cluster and includes components like the API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd (a distributed key-value store). Worker nodes run the applications in containers managed by components like kubelet and kube-proxy35.
